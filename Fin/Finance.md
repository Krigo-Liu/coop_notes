## 1.1 Trading items

1. Different markets

   1. stock market, equity. selling and buying stocks.
   2. option exchanges期权:是一种选择权，指是一种能在未来某特定时间以特定价格买入或卖出一定数量的某种特定商品的权利。

   > Asset: sth. of value your company owns
   > Liability: any debt your company owes others
   >
3. Security

   A security is a document which entitles the holder to some asset of another person. Almost all securities can be considered an **asset of the holder** ("securitize an asset"), but not all assets are securities.

   > 3 categories:
   >
   > - debt securities (bonds)  债券：Bonds, Treasury bills, and certificates of deposit.
   > - equity securities (stocks) 股票：Common stocks, preferred stocks, index funds, and ETFs.
   > - derivative securities 衍生证券:
   > - stock index futures(股指期货)：buy or sell the value of a specific stock index at a predetermined future date and price.
   > - stock index options(股指期权):These are options that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the value of a specific stock index at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date.

   There are 3 options if you own a business and needing money ($1,000,000), except for getting a loan from a bank [1]:

   - **Bond**
     An investment bank helps you issue a $1,000,000 bond with a fixed interest rate. If you can't repay, creditors can *take control of your company and sell assets*. Bonds are safer than stocks because creditors have priority. Bondholders might get something back if the company goes bankrupt.
   - **Equity Security (Stock)**
     You sell 10,000 shares at $100 each, raising $1,000,000. Stockholders own part of the company but don’t get fixed interest. They might receive dividends (amout varies from y to y.). Stockholders won’t be liable beyond their investment if the company goes bankrupt. //From the market view: stock prices are det. by the value & expected performance of the company -> bid and ask behavior. The future price is uncertain. Volatility determines the amount of stock price differ from the expected value.
   - **Derivative Securities**
     These include forwards（远期）, swaps（掉期）, futures（期货）, and options（期权）, used to hedge against price changes in commodities, currencies, and interest rates.These are basically **bets on the price a commodity** (anything from milk to corn to oil to cows to stocks to bets on interest rates and currencies, etc.). Companies use these to protect themselves against future price changes. Companies like McDonald's and Southwest Airlines use derivatives to stabilize costs for inputs like beef and oil. Multinational companies use them to manage currency exchange risks.
4. stock index is not tradable. A stock index is a **statistical measure** that reflects the **composite value of a selected group of stocks**. It is used to represent the performance of a specific section of the stock market, or the market as a whole, and is often used by investors to compare the performance of their investments.
   But there are some primary tradable instruments **based on** stock indices:

   1. **Index Funds**:
      - **Mutual Funds**: These are investment funds designed to track the performance of a specific stock index. Investors can buy shares of these funds.
      - **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: These are similar to mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks.
   2. **stock index futures**: **Futures Contracts**: These are standardized contracts to buy or sell the value of a specific stock index at a predetermined future date and price. They are traded on futures exchanges.
   3. **Stock Index Options**- **Options Contracts**: These provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call options) or sell (put options) the value of a specific stock index at a predetermined price before or at the expiration date.
   4. index warrants:**Warrants**: These are similar to options but are typically issued by financial institutions and give the holder the right to buy or sell an index at a specified price before expiration.
   5. index CFDs(contracts for difference):**CFDs**: These are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of a stock index without owning the underlying assets.

## 1.2 Market Players

### 1.2.1 Primary market (一级市场)[5]

Where securities are created. Securities are purchased directly from an issuer.

Players:

1. Issuers(发行人): entities seeking to raise capital. companies, governments,...
2. Underwriters (承销商): help to price & sell the new securities: investment banks
3. Investors (institutional and individual): who purchase the newly issued securities. Retail investors are less common in primary markets.

   |                      | stage              | size            | risk & return     | ownership       |
   | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
   | venture capital (VC) | seed stage         | smaller(rounds) | high,high         | minority stakes |
   | private equity (PE)  | mature(profitable) | bigger          | lower,more steady | majority stakes |

Events:

1. Initial Public Offering (IPO).A process by which a private company offers its shares to the **public (general public and institutional investors)** for the first time and becomes a publicly traded company on a stock exchange.
   Impact on Ownership: Founders and early investors may dilute (make weaker) their ownership in the company as new shares are issued to the public.
2. Rights Offering:Allows a company to raise additional capital by offering more shares to its current shareholders.Shareholders are given the right to purchase additional shares at a discount to the current market price, typically on a pro-rata basis (i.e., in proportion to their existing holdings).
   Impact on Ownership: Existing shareholders can maintain their proportional ownership in the company by exercising their rights. If they choose not to participate, their ownership percentage will dilute.

E.g.
Businesses and governments that want to generate debt capital(债务资本) can choose to issue new short- and long-term bonds on the primary market. New bonds are issued with coupon rates(票面利率) that correspond to the current interest rates(利率) at the time of issuance, which may be higher or lower than pre-existing bonds.

### 1.2.2 Secondary market (二级市场)

Where securities are traded (Investors trade among themselves). It is basically the stock market and refers to the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, and other exchanges worldwide[5].

Players [7]:

1. Market maker(做市商) :liquidity provider firms that stand ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly
   quoted price. Earns from spreads and commission(佣金).
2. Arbitrageurs(套利者):traders that take advantage of a price difference between two or
   more markets.
3. Speculators(投机者):take risk on purpose by betting on future movements of the security’s
   price without any logical reasons. Attempting to profit from short-term fluctuations. No risk control.
4. Hedgers(对冲): goal: protect the portfolio from losing value at the expense of
   lowering the possible benefits. Hedging.
5. Investors(投资者):allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial
   return. types: individual(through traditional/ online brokerage firms or saving accounts (part 3)/private equity,hedge funds) and institutional.

### 1.2.3 “Third” and "fourth" markets (三、四级市场)

Deals between broker-dealers经纪自营商 and institutions through over-the-counter electronic networks and are therefore not as relevant to individual investors [5].
A broker-dealer (B-D) is a person or firm in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers [6].

OTC:"over-the-counter" generally refers to stocks that are not trading on a stock exchange such as the Nasdaq, NYSE, or American Stock Exchange (AMEX) [5].

## 1.2 Numbers
